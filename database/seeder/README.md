# ðŸ“¦ Package `seeder`

**Source Path:** `pkg/database/seeder`

## ðŸ§© Types

### `Deps`

Deps is a struct that contains the dependencies for the seeder

```go
type Deps struct {
	DB *db.Queries
	Hash hash.HashPassword
	Ctx context.Context
	Logger logger.LoggerInterface
}
```

### `Seeder`

Seeder is a struct that contains all the seeders

```go
type Seeder struct {
	User *userSeeder
	Role *roleSeeder
	Saldo *saldoSeeder
	Topup *topupSeeder
	Withdraw *withdrawSeeder
	Transfer *transferSeeder
	Merchant *merchantSeeder
	Card *cardSeeder
	Transaction *transactionSeeder
}
```

#### Methods

##### `Run`

Run runs all the seeders in sequence with a delay of 30 seconds
between each seeder.

It calls the Seed method of each seeder in the following order:

1. User
2. Role
3. Card
4. Saldo
5. Topup
6. Withdraw
7. Transfer
8. Merchant
9. Transaction

If any of the seeders fail, the function returns an error.

Returns:
an error if any of the seeders fail, otherwise nil

```go
func (s *Seeder) Run() error
```

##### `seedWithDelay`

seedWithDelay is a helper function that seeds the given entity with a delay of 30 seconds.

It takes the name of the entity and a seed function as parameters.
The seed function is called, and if it returns an error, the function returns an error with a message
that includes the name of the entity.
After the seed function has been called, the function sleeps for 30 seconds to allow the next seeder
to run without interfering with the previous one.

Args:
entityName - the name of the entity being seeded
seedFunc - the seed function to be called

Returns:
an error if the seed function fails, otherwise nil

```go
func (s *Seeder) seedWithDelay(entityName string, seedFunc func() error) error
```

```

#### Methods

##### `Seed`

Seed populates the cards table with fake data.

It generates 10 cards, 5 of which are active and 5 of which are trashed.
The cards are seeded with random card numbers, card types, expire dates, and
CVV numbers. The card provider is randomly selected from a list of providers.

```

### `saldoSeeder`

saldoSeeder is a struct that represents a seeder for the saldos table.

It generates 10 saldos, 5 of which are active and 5 of which are trashed.
The saldos are seeded with random totalBalance values, and the cardNumber
is randomly selected from the cards table.

If any errors occur during the seeding process, an error is returned.

Returns:
an error if any of the saldos fail to be created, otherwise nil

```go
func (r *saldoSeeder) Seed() error
```

### `topupSeeder`

topupSeeder is a struct that represents a seeder for the topups table.

}
```

#### Methods

##### `Seed`

Seed populates the topups table with fake data.

It creates a total of 10 topups, with 5 of them being active and 5 of them being
trashed. The topups are seeded with a random card number, topup amount, topup method,
and topup time. The status of the topup is randomly set to one of the following:
pending, success, or failed.
